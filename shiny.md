# Dashboard

The HQL code is not very exciting in this project because there is only one table and the 
column names are masked so it is difficult to formulate interesting analytic questions.

I will add the instructions to set up the next part soon, but it involves moving the data 
from the flat files to GCP's BigQuery. Once the data is there, we can use it to build a Shiny 
app.

```r
